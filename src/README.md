# Light weight project management app

The idea of this project is to push Ionic and Firebase to its limits testing role based authentication and an invite system without any server side code.

The app goes over:

* Creating an admin account.
* Having the admin invite other team members.
* Team members accepting those invitations.
* Admin approving accounts.
* Admin ads taks to different team members.
* People can only see what's assigned to them.

This app is showcased and explained step by step in me [Ionic and Firebase Book](https://javebratt.com/ionic-firebase-book).

If you're just getting started I created a free Ionic and Firebase Crash Course, you can [check it out here](https://javebratt.com/signup/?ref=ProjectPlannerGithubRepo).
